***

ðŸ““ The purpose of this project is to 
build a technical documentation page
that fulfills the following abridged user stories:

- [x] must have a <samp>`<main>`</samp> element with an `id="main-doc"`
- [x] within the `#main-doc` there's a minimum of *5* <samp>`<section>`</samp> element each with `class="main-section"`
- [x] the first element with each `.main-section` is a <samp>`<header>`</samp> element containing the title text/topic of that section
- [x] each <samp>`<section>`</samp> element should have an `id` that corresponds with the text of each <samp>`<header>`</samp> contained within it
- [x] the `.main-section` elements should contain at least *10* <samp>`<p>`</samp> elements total (not each).
- [x] the `.main-section` elements should contain at least *5* <samp>`<code>`</samp> elements total (not each).
- [x] the `.main-section` elements should contain at least *5* <samp>`<li>`</samp> items total (not each).
- [x] there's a <samp>`<nav>`</samp> element with a corresponding `id="navbar"`.
- [x] the `navbar` element should contain one <samp>`<header>`</samp> element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation.
- [x] the `navbar` contains <samp>`<a>`</samp> elements with a `class="nav-link"`.
- [x] the <samp>`<header>`</samp> element in the navbar must come before any link <samp>`<a>`</samp> elements in the navbar.
- [x] each element with the class of `nav-link` should contain text that corresponds to the <samp>`<header>`</samp> text within each <samp>`<section>`</samp>.
- [x] when a `navbar` element is clicked, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the `main-doc` element.
- [ ] on regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with `id="navbar"` should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user.
- [ ] the technical documentation page should use atleast one media query.
